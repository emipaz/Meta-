## Task 1: Create a valid HTML document that displays a piece of text.

Objectives
- Add the **DOCTYPE**.
- Add the HTML, head and body elements.
- Add the title element.
- Add the text to the body element.

Follow the Step by Step instructions below:

1. Open the `index.html` file.

2. Type `<!DOCTYPE html>` on the first line.

3. Create your `html` element on the next line. This will be the root element of the document.

4. Add the `head` element inside the `html` element. The head element contains data about the HTML document that does not display in the web browser.  

5. Add the `title` element inside the `head` element.

6. Add the text `My First HTML Document` inside the `title` element. The content of the `title` element is the text that will be displayed in the web browser tab.   

7. Close the `head` tag and add the `body` element. The ``body element contains all displayable content of the webpage.

8. Add the text `I successfully created my first document` inside the `body` element. This displays on the webpage.
